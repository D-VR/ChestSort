THIS UPDATE IS IMPORTANT WHEN YOU ARE USING PLUGINS THAT INTERACT WITH CHESTSORT
Note: When you are using other plugins that depend on the ChestSortAPI 2.0.0+ (e.g. probably the next release of ItemJoin AFAIK) you need at least this version of ChestSort.

## 6.0
Added middle-click shortcut

You can now sort any inventory by middle-clicking any slot within that inventory. This is useful if you do not want to enable automatic sorting, but only want to sort a chest or your own inventory from time to time. This also means that you do not have to use /invsort or /isort anymore - just middle click into your player inventory

## 5.1
- Fixes exceptions when using SPigot versions prior to 1.11

## 5.0.3

- {keepCategoryOrder} now works
- sticky category files now work

## 5.0
- The config file will update itself automatically when a new version is released. Your old changes will be kept, so you always see the new config options without having to redo all your changes.
- Categories can be set to sticky in the category file. That means that the items in this category will be ordered exactly as in the file. Without setting sticky, the items in one category will only be grouped together and sorted according to the other variables in your sorting-method.
- New placeholders for your sorting-method including custom item name (e.g. when renamed with an anvil) and lore. You can also use {keepCategoryOrder} behind {category}. This will have the same effect as when you set all categories to sticky.

/invsort all will sort both
- Changed order of default category files. The valuables and tools category have switched places, so that tools is now the first category.
- Update Spigot-API to 1.14. ChestSort already worked with 1.14, but now it uses the new API natively.

## 4.0
- Player Inventory sorting! Players can sort their inventory using /invsort or /isort. This requires the chestsort.use.inventory permission
- Support for all major Minecraft versions! This version has been tested with 1.8, 1.11, 1.13.2 and 1.14, so it should work with every version between 1.8 and 1.14

- Sorting has been improved for many things, like corals, stripped_log and many more
- Automatic update checker integrated. On Server startup and every 24 hours there will be a check if a new version is available. If yes, it is displayed in the console and to OPs on logging in. You can toggle this in the config.yml (check every 24 hours, check only on startup or don't check at all)
